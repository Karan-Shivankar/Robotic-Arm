# Robotic-Arm
Introduction

In recent years, the field of robotics has witnessed significant growth due to advancements in embedded systems, wireless communication, and low-cost manufacturing. Robotic arms, which mimic the functions of a human arm, are widely used in industries for tasks such as assembly, material handling, and precision operations. However, the high cost and complexity of industrial robotic arms often make them inaccessible for students, hobbyists, and small-scale applications. This project addresses that challenge by developing a cost-effective robotic arm built using PVC pipes and controlled wirelessly through Wi-Fi, offering a practical solution for education, experimentation, and low-budget automation.

The structure of the robotic arm is constructed entirely from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes, which are inexpensive, lightweight, and readily available in most hardware stores. PVC pipes are easy to cut, drill, and assemble, making them ideal for building custom mechanical structures without the need for advanced tools or machining processes. The joints of the arm are powered by servo motors, which are capable of precise angular positioning and are suitable for applications that require controlled movement and repeatability.

At the heart of the control system lies the ESP32 microcontroller, a powerful and energy-efficient board equipped with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. The ESP32 manages all motor control signals and acts as a wireless access point or station, enabling users to connect and control the robotic arm through a web-based interface hosted on the microcontroller itself. This interface can be accessed using any device with a web browser—such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer—eliminating the need for external applications or software installations.

One of the key features of this project is the ability to record and replay servo movements. This allows users to create a sequence of motions and play them back as needed, which is particularly useful for repetitive tasks. The combination of real-time control and automated playback adds versatility and functionality to the system, making it suitable for both interactive demonstrations and semi-autonomous operations.

The main motivation behind this project is to create a functional robotic arm that is not only low-cost and easy to build but also wirelessly controllable, thereby eliminating the limitations imposed by physical connections and enhancing user convenience. This makes it a valuable educational tool for teaching principles of robotics, control systems, mechanical design, and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies. Additionally, the use of Wi-Fi for communication demonstrates a practical implementation of wireless robotic control systems, which are increasingly important in modern industry and smart automation.

3. Servo Motor Drive (Controller)
•	Overview:
A servo motor drive (also known as a servo controller) is an electronic component responsible for controlling the speed, position, and direction of a servo motor. The drive interprets control signals (usually PWM) from the microcontroller (ESP32) and powers the servos accordingly.
